# USpaceStation13

USpaceStation13 is a crowdsourced video game that is a clone of the original Space Station 13 built on Unreal Engine 4.

Everyone is allowed to contribute pull requests to the code. Milestone list with what is needed next for the project soon to come.

The game has a planned revenue and contributors will be rewarded proportionally once revenue kicks in. More on the propotional formula for revenue attribution on AGREEMENT.md

**Why a clone**
The original game features an awesome gameplay under a game engine that is outdated and with low multi-platform support. So, why not!

**How do contributors get compensated**
This is a work in progress but here is the gist: all contributions can be measured through commits. This means the fine details of how many bytes and lines of text someone has added. A formula can then be used to measure proportionally the amount of code contributed throughout the lifetime of an account and on a monthly basis. Then if say the project collects $1000 in ad revenue for a month and an individual delivered 20% of the code or materials, they get $200. The details of the "formula" are a work in progress that is expected to be discussed a lot by the community building the game in order for the distribution of the compensation to be fair.

**Why not opensource?**
Open source software has some great qualities but it is released with the expectation that it will be free and if revenue will be made that will be through services (such as support or selling servers). The developers of open source games do not get paid and even if there is a revenue stream, nothing prevents anyone from forking a project, putting a variant name on it, crediting the original owners and distributing it for free. All the work from the developers of the initial project just receives credit but no compensation. As such this project has a source code that is available for personal use, educational purposes but does not permit redistribution of a *modified* source code that is not part of an official release at this repository. A concrete example, if the game contains ads, you can edit the source code and remove them if they are a nuisance and you don't want to give something to the developers. But, you are not allowed to redistribute that modified version. Hence, most users are expected to use the client developed at the official repository.

## Final notes
Consider the README and the repository a work in progress where things are bound to change as the project changes and matures.
